# Latent-Manager (A work in progress)

## Description

A React application created to simplify and streamline the management of latent finger and palm print case work at my day job. It was originally built to be a standalone Electron application but works better as a web based application for my purposes. 

Working as a crime scene investigator, I am not thrilled with our current software/database. My colleagues and I constantly wish for different things, or discuss how it would be nice if we could do this and that. So I decided to build an application that I could cater to our exact needs. The application is meant to provide simplified and efficient management of our latent print case work to do away with physical case files and paper work.

## Usage

The application currently allows for the following in conjunction with a mongoDB Atlas server:
- Searching for latent case files through the database
- Adding, viewing and editing case/latent information
